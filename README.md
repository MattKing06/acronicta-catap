### Acronicta CATAP

A python library that combines Pydantic and Jinja2 templating to produce a facility-specific middle layer for EPICS-based control systems


### How to generate your middle layer

- Provide a set of folders with YAML files that describe your hardware components.
```bash
- yaml/
  - BPM/
    - DEVICE-01.yaml
    - DEVICE-02.yaml
    - ...
  - Cavity/
    - CAVITY-01.yaml
    - CAVITY-02.yaml
    - ...
  - ...
```
- Each component file must provide the following information at least:
  - `controls_information`
    - `pv_record_map` : A set of PVs (see example below)
  - `properties`
    - `name`: Full name of the component
    - `hardware_type`: Type of component (this links with the Model/Hardware class generation)
    - `subtype`: Subtype (i.e. QUADRUPOLE, DIPOLE, etc.)
    - `machine_area`: Used in generation to setup `MACHINE_AREAS` constants
    - `position`: Used to sort components
```yaml
# example file in ./yaml/BPM/DEVICE-01.yaml

controls_information:
    pv_record_map:
        X:
            type: scalar
            description: "X position readback for the BPM"
            units: "mm"
            pv: "BPM-DEVICE-01:X"
        Y:
            type: statistical
            auto_buffer: true
            buffer_size: 100
            description: "X position readback for the BPM"
            units: "mm"
            pv: "BPM-DEVICE-01:Y"
properties:
    name: DEVICE-01
    hardware_type: BPM
    subtype: STRIPLINE
    machine_area: A1
    position: 1.0
```

### Running the generation script

From the top level directory, you should be able to do:

``` bash
python ./scripts/generate_hardware.py --yaml_location "<yaml-directory>" --output_location "<output-directory>" --overwrite_hardware
```

For the first time you run the generation, you will need to supply the `--overwrite_hardware` argument to generate the `hardware/` folder with componennt defintions in.

After the first time, you may not want to overwrite the hardware classes due to them have facility specific logic in there. If this is the case, do not supply the `--overwrite_hardware` option.

### Testing your generated middle layer

- Go into the output location
- Open a python interpreter and you should be able to do something like:

```python
# import your factory
from hardware.magnet import MagnetFactory

# create your factory
magnets = MagnetFactory(is_virtual=False)

# get a parameter for all components in the factory.
magnets.current()

```
